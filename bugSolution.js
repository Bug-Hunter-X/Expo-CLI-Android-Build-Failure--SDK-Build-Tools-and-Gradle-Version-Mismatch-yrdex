The solution involves carefully examining your project's `android/gradle` files, specifically the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file, to ensure compatibility between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version and the Android SDK build tools. You might need to update or downgrade these versions to resolve the conflict.

**Steps:**
1. **Check Gradle Version:** Look for the `distributionUrl` property in `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`. This specifies your Gradle version.
2. **Check AGP Version:** Open the `android/build.gradle` file and check the `classpath` of the dependencies block, look for the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` entry. This indicates your Android Gradle Plugin version.
3. **Compatibility:**  Consult the official Android developer documentation for compatibility tables between AGP versions and Gradle versions and SDK Build tools versions.
4. **Update or Downgrade:** Adjust the `distributionUrl` in `gradle-wrapper.properties` and the `classpath` in `android/build.gradle` as necessary to establish compatibility.  You might also need to update the buildToolsVersion in your `android/app/build.gradle`.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making these changes, run `expo prebuild` then `expo build:android`  or clean your project's build folder before rebuilding.
